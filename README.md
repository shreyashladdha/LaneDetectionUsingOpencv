# LaneDetectionUsingOpencv
Lane detection for self driving cars using OpenCV and python3
OpenCv based lane detector module for an input stream of on lane video of road. This detector uses the popular canny edge detector to identify the gradients and finally
detect the lanes on the road. To avoid edges outside the road to be detected, we simply define the region of intrest to the road. We can further incoperate deep learning 
algorithms to improve the module and make it more smart and functional.
